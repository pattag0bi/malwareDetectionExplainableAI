Malware Detection Using Explainable AI
This project develops an efficient and explainable malware detection system using machine learning techniques and explainable AI methods. The system addresses challenges posed by high-dimensional datasets and the black-box nature of traditional ML models in cybersecurity applications.
Key Features
Feature Selection: Utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most critical features for distinguishing malware.
Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers for accurate malware detection.
Explainable AI: Leverages SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparency into model decisions.
Dataset Balancing: Employs SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance issues.
Performance Highlights
Both Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved impressive results:
Accuracy: 97%
Recall: 98%
Precision: 95%
F1 Score: 97%
ROC AUC: 97%
Explainability Insights
The project utilizes various SHAP visualization techniques to interpret model decisions:
